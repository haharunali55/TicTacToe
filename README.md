# TicTacToe

This is a simple game of TicTacToe built using React components and features.

I am making use of useState and useEffect hooks to get different behaviours. Buttons and other stylings are done using CSS.

There are 3 components - Board, Square and Mode.

This game can be played in 2 modes - Single player and Multi player.

Once a winner is determined, Reset button should be pressed to reset state and restart the game.

Pre-requisites : You need to have node and npm installed.

To run the game in your local, follow the below steps :
1. Clone the project in your local and open it in Visual Studio Code or an IDE of your choice.

2. Open terminal from the project directory and execute the following command to give executable permission to the startup.sh file : 
-for Mac users, chmod +x startup.sh
-for Windows users, chmod +x startup.bat

3. Then execute the startup file which will automatically setup the environment to play the game.
-for Mac users, ./startup.sh
-for Windows users, startup.bat and Enter

4. Once setup is done, you will be asked to open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to play the game.
